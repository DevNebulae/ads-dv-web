        On the 22<sup>nd</sup> of February 2017, Old-School RuneScape was
        introduced to Jagex' game catalogue after many players requested it came
        back. Approximately half of the player base stopped playing after a
        large update to the combat system. Six years later, a back-up of the
        year 2007 was restored and many players are now enjoying the game they
        knew as RuneScape. To avoid confusion, the game is now called Old-School
        RuneScape and it lives alongside the more modern RuneScape, more often
        called RuneScape 3 by the RuneScape playerbase.

        RuneScape has an in-game market called the Grand Exchange. Players can
        sell their goods they produced and players can buy items they need for
        quests, improving their skills or fashion. Players exchange a huge
        amount of cash each day via this market, but how do these prices get
        influenced? To find out, I made a visualization about my exploration to
        find the answers.
