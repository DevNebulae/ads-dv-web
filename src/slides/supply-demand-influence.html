        <p>Economics in high school teaches students that there is a causal relation between the abundance of a product and
          its price. To link this to the real-world, think of the prices of diesel and gasoline. When crude oil becomes more
          scarce, like an oil-rig which has mechanical problems, the crude oil becomes more scarce and the end products become
          more expensive.

          <p>The decrease in drop rate of raw sharks in the boss' drop table caused the amount of sharks entering the market
            to drop, making the price rise. However, the amount of bought sharks decreased, which seems rather odd. One could
            speak of a mental effect rather than a causul relation.</p>

        <div class="text-reveal fragment" data-fragment-index="4">
          <p>The amount of bought- and sold sharks decreased by the same amount. The Inferno mini-game requires vastly different
            gear and supplies, meaning that sharks are not sufficient. Causing the players to not appreciate sharks as much
            and players not fishing for sharks, because they were playing the mini-game.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-reveal fragment" data-fragment-index="5">
          <p>Due to the now easier way of acquiring sharks, there is a huge spike of bought- and sold raw sharks which oversaturated
            the market for raw sharks. It takes less effort now to fish for sharks, causing the players to depreciate the
            sharks and causing the prices to drop. Players were now buying sharks en masse due to their cheap price.

        <div class="text-reveal fragment" data-fragment-index="6">
          <p>The last noteworthy thing is that during the last update, the prices of sharks plummeted, even though there is
            no direct impact on the supply and demand of the item. The reason the price dropped is that that update introduced
            a new fishing method which levels faster than fishing sharks, causing people to lose interest in fishing sharks.
            The explanation for the decrease of bought sharks is that there was a long hiatus with any combat content, meaning
            that players lost interest in the game.</p>
