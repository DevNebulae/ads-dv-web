      <h2>Updates and price fluctuations</h2>

      <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">The theory behind this hypotheses is that prices are influenced by updates, because raw sharks are such an important
        item to the playerbase of RuneScape. It is one of the go-to food sources and updates to Player-versus-Monster (PvM)
        or Player-versus-Player (PvP) content makes raw sharks either more- or less desirable depending on the impact of
        the update. This phenomena is usually called appreciation in economics: players either see more- or less use in a
        certain item and are respectively willing to pay more or less for an item.</p>

      <div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">
        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>As you can see in the chart, the prices of raw sharks is only influenced by a certain number of updates. At around
          the release of a game-balancing update on the 25
          <sup>th</sup> of May 2017, a boss' drop table was altered to drop less sharks. Meaning that less sharks will enter the
          market as an effect. This translated to a spike in their price.</p>

      <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">However, in the Fishing Guild update on the 6
        <sup>th</sup> of July 2017, a new way of fishing raw sharks was introduced. Meaning that the supply of sharks will be
        greatly increased again, causing the price to drop back to its old value before the 25
        <sup>th</sup> of May 2017.</p>

      <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">On June 1
        <sup>st</sup> 2017, a new mini-game was released to RuneScape called the Inferno. The Inferno is one of the hardest mini-games
        in RuneScape and lead to a spike of demand in supplies needed for the inferno.</p>

      <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6">Concluding, updates are a cause for an increase or decrease in the demand or supply of items. In the next slide, this
        will be explored.</p>

      <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7">A very interesting observation needs to be made and that is that the RuneScape players seem to overreact every time
        a controversial or game-balancing update has been released. This causes the price to extremely fluctuate after or
        even before the update has been released and only to drop to a more normal price.</p>
