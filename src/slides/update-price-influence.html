      <h2>Updates and price fluctuations</h2>

      <div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
        <p>The theory behind this hypotheses is that prices are influenced by updates, because raw sharks are such an important
          item to the playerbase of RuneScape. It is one of the go-to food sources and updates to Player-versus-Monster (PvM)
          or Player-versus-Player (PvP) content makes raw sharks either more- or less desirable depending on the impact of
          the update. This phenomena is usually called appreciation in economics: players either see more- or less use in
          a certain item and are respectively willing to pay more or less for an item.</p>

          <p>The prices of raw sharks is only majorly influenced by a certain number of updates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-reveal fragment" data-fragment-index="5">
          <p>At the release of a game-balancing update, a boss' drop table was altered to drop less sharks. Meaning that less
            sharks will enter the market as an effect, causing the price to rise.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-reveal fragment" data-fragment-index="6">
          <p>A new mini-game was released to RuneScape called the Inferno. The Inferno is the hardest mini-game and lead to
            a spike of demand in supplies such as food and potions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-reveal fragment" data-fragment-index="7">
          <p>In the Fishing Guild update, a new way of fishing sharks was introduced. The supply of sharks greatly increased
            again, causing the price to drop.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-reveal fragment" data-fragment-index="8">
          <p>A very interesting observation needs to be made and that is that the RuneScape players seem to overreact every
            time a controversial or game-balancing update has been released. This causes the price to extremely fluctuate
            after or even before the update has been released and only to drop to a more normal price shortly afterwards.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="text-reveal fragment" data-fragment-index="9">Concluding, updates are a cause for an increase or decrease in the demand or supply of items. In the next slide,
            this will be explored.</p>
