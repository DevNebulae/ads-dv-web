          <p>In the following visualizations, you will be shown the transactional data of an in-game item called a "Raw shark".
            Sharks are a very important food item in the game, since it gives you health after you have taken damage from
            monsters or other players. This item is very important to any players killing monsters, players killing other
            players and players doing risky mini-games where death is lurking in every corner.</p>
