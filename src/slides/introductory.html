        <h3>RuneScape</h3>
        <p>RuneScape is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) created and maintained by Jagex. In this game,
          you can gather, farm and even slay monsters for items which you can sell to other players. The question quickly
          arises: “How do people determine the prices of items?”</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>The limitations to this research are that only items which have been sold through the central marketplace have been
          tracked and that player-to-player trading is untrackable.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>In RuneScape, players don’t trade with each other with any real-world currency. In fact, the game rules state that
          that is illegal. Instead, players trade with each other with an in-game currency called
          <em class="italic">gold points</em>, which is commonly abbreviated as &ldquo;gp&rdquo;.</p>
